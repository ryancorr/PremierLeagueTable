# PremierLeagueTable

Welcome to my Premier League Table. 

I wanted to start a project that would help me learn Django, web development, and SQL. Since I've been a soccer fan for a long time and have played the game from 5 years old 
all the way through college, there was no better first project for me to do than the something about the English Premier League that I have watched for years. 

So far I have constructed a page to dynamically display the current standings, a page for all the upcoming matches, a information page for each team with their players and some basic information about the club, and a way to input the games scores and have it update the table as well. I just finished a way for users to register for accounts login and logout, and planing on making a discussion board where people can make posts and comment on them as well.
